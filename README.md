Linked Data Workflow Project ontology
====

Maintaining Linked Data datasets is a time-consuming and resource-expensive activity. The cost of maintainability can be reduced by utilizing a workflow description framework, which provides methods to support the lifecycle of RDF datasets in a systematic way. We present the main component of such a framework, an ontology for orchestrating Linked Data processing workflows dubbed the Linked Data Workflow Project ontology. We introduce the Plan, Method, and Execution concepts, which enable to describe important maintenance tasks. Using our ontology it is possible to: i) Describe the complete production workflow for RDF datasets, thus enabling reproducibility over time; ii) Describe the methods and tools utilized in such a workflow; and iii) Execute the described workflows in a (semi-)automatized way, using Linked Data technologies.

Report Generator

```
To use Report Generator Tool go to tool/reportgen/ folder and run "$ java -jar reportgen.jar". The command will output a help message for the Report Generator tool.
```

Workflow Execution
====
```
To use Workflow Execution Tool go to tool/ldStackWorkflow/ folder and run "$ java -jar ldStackWorkflow.jar". The command will output a help message for the Workflow Execution Tool.
