Linked Data Projects Ontology
====

Creation, production, and reproduction of linked datasets are not trivial. Substantial efforts and resources are consumed during a Workflow execution. It is suitable that these efforts should be planned as a Project, based on a development Process, and performed in a systematic Workflow. This repository contains the Linked Data Project Ontology (LDPO), a lightweight ontology for modeling Process and Workflow aspects in Linked Data Projects. The ontology considers the Linked Data Lifecycle and the Linked Data Stack. Also, here you can find various tools utilizing LDPO such as Report generator.

```
