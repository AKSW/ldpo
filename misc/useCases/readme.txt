Instructions for running toy experiments
===

There are three possible toy experiments to run LDWPO:  
* runningQualisBrasilProjectReports.sh

To do that, the environment should be setup:
- user and password for virtuoso = "dba" and "dba"
- user and password for mysql = 
- install LIMES
- install Sparqlify
- create the sh files for calling LIMES and Sparqlify (Ivan did that for me)

 we can execute toy experiments for:
 - executing the workflow for qualisConversion LDWProject 2005
 - executing the workflow for qualisConversion LDWProject 2006
 - executing the workflow for qualisInterlinking LDWProject
 - generating the LDWProject Report of qualisConversion
